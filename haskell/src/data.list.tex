\subsubsection{Set operations}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
-- (Eq a) => [a] -> [a]
nub = nubBy (==)

nubBy p []     = []
nubBy p (x:xs) = x : 
  nubBy p (filter (\ y -> not (p x y)) xs)
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Ordered lists}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
-- (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]  
sort []     = []  
sort (x:xs) =   
  let large = sort $ filter (> x) xs
    small = sort $ filter (<= x) xs
  in small ++ ([x]:large)
\end{minted}
