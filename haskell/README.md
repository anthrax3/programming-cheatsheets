1. **The Haskell Cheatsheet** by Justin Bailey at <http://cheatsheet.codeslower.com/>.
*Learning Haskell is not easy. 
Besides the syntax, concepts, and advanced types, there is a real lack of succinct, accessible references. 
As I learned Haskell I frequently wanted a quick reference for syntax, keywords and other language elements. 
The Haskell Report, while very thorough, wasn't quite it.
For that reason I've created this cheatsheet. 
It's intended for beginning to intermediate Haskell programmers to use 
as a quick-reference guide for syntax, keywords or other language issues.*

3. **Learn you a Haskell** by M. Lipovaca at <http://learnyouahaskell.com/>.
*Hey yo! This is Learn You a Haskell, the funkiest way to learn Haskell, which is the best functional programming language around. You may have heard of it. This guide is meant for people who have programmed already, but have yet to try functional programming.*

2. **Real World Haskell** by B. O'Sullivan, D. Stewart and J. Goerzen at <http://book.realworldhaskell.org/>.
*This easy-to-use, fast-moving tutorial introduces you to functional programming with Haskell. You'll learn how to use Haskell in a variety of practical ways, from short scripts to large and demanding applications. Real World Haskell takes you through the basics of functional programming at a brisk pace, and then helps you increase your understanding of Haskell in real-world issues like I/O, performance, dealing with data, concurrency, and more as you move through each chapter.*

## Useful tools
1. **Hoogle** at <https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/>.
*Hoogle is a Haskell API search engine, which allows you to search many standard Haskell libraries by either function name, or by approximate type signature.*
